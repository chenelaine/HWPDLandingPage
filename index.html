                starting a company, and all they need to learn is the business side. The reality is that they don't
                always have the time and opportunity to experience all the work that goes into developing a quality
                hardware product. Elaine has taken her broad experience and boiled it down to a roadmap that can help a
                new hardware entrepreneur know what to expect and to plan for success. It has lots of wisdom from
                experience, and it brings this to the reader in a very practical and useful manner. An extremely
                valuable read for the hardware entrepreneur."
